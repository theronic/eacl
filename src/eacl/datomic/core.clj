;; How to Configure Spice Object ID Coercion

; SpiceDB uses strings for subject/resource IDs, but internally EACL uses Datomic :db/id Long IDs.
; EACL lets you configure how to coerce internal Datomic IDs to/from an external ID, typically via a lookup-ref, e.g.
(comment
  (eacl.datomic.core/make-client conn {:entity->object-id (fn [ent] (:your/ident ent))
                                       :object-id->ident  (fn [obj-id] [:your/ident obj-id])}))
; Typical usage here is if you already have a UUID attribute you want to use for coercion.
; If you do not intend to expose EACL to an external system, you can use internal Datomic IDs, e.g.
(comment
  (eacl.datomic.core/make-client conn {:entity->object-id (fn [ent] (:db/id ent))
                                       :object-id->ident  (fn [obj-id] obj-id)})) ;; passthrough.
