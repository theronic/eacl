(defn Permission
  "Defines a Permission via

    (Permission :resource_type :permission_name spec)

  Where `spec` describes one of:
   1. Direct Relation  {:relation local_relation}
   2. Arrow Relation   {:arrow relation, :relation via-relation}
   3. Arrow Permission {:arrow relation, :permission via-permission}
   4. Self Permission  {:permission other_permission}

  Note that EACL does not detect or prevent cycles in schema (big todo!).

  E.g. given the following SpiceDB definition:

  definition user {}

  definition account {
    relation owner: user

    permission admin = owner
  }

  definition product {
    relation account: account

    permission direct_permission  = account
    permission arrow_relation     = account->owner
    permission arrow_permission   = account->admin
    permission self_permission    = direct_relation

    permission union_permission   = account + account->admin
  }

  In EACL, this would be modelled as:

    (Relation :account :owner :user)
    (Relation :product :account :account)

    (Permission :product :direct_relation  {:relation :account})
    (Permission :product :arrow_relation   {:arrow :account :relation :owner})
    (Permission :product :arrow_permission {:arrow :account :permission :admin})
    (Permission :product :self_permission  {:permission :admin})

  For a self permission, the omitted :arrow is inferred as :self (reserved word).

  In the future, when EACL manages schema via write-schema!, arrow specs will be
  able to support :arrow->permission or :arrow->relation syntax."
